# 🚫 PornBlocker Chrome Extension

A minimalist, privacy-focused Chrome extension that **blocks pornographic websites** and **logs each attempt** with a timestamp for transparency and accountability.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Blocks access to sites containing pornographic keywords

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone or [download this repository](https://github.com/zuyomi/porn-blocker/releases)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
> or, if you have a chromium-based browser, try `**browser**//extenstions`
4. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right)
5. Click **Load Unpacked**
6. Select the project folder

## 🧠 How It Works

The extension listens for all outgoing web requests. If a URL contains any banned keyword (e.g., `porn`, `xxx`, `nsfw`, etc.), it will block the request and log the event in the browser's local storage.

- Lists all blocked URLs with timestamps
